# Prisoners loop strategy in python
An implentation of the prisoners loop strategy in python.

Following Veritasium's fantastic video, this is a python interpretation of the prisoner's loop streategy.
The basis of this problem is that there are 100 prisoners. The prisoners are taken to a room with 100 boxes each containing a random prisoners' ID within them.
The (clearly maniacle) prison guards say that:

-Each prisoner is to open no more than 50 boxes to find their number

-If every prisoner finds the box which contains their number, they are all set free

-If even one prisoner fails to find their box, they are all executed

-They are allowed to strategise beforehand but must complete the task one-by-one.
